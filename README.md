## About

llm-spell is both a library and command-line utility that
corrects spelling mistakes using a Large Language Model (LLM).
It is powered by [llm.rb](https://github.com/llmrb/llm).

## Features

- ‚ú® **LLM-powered corrections** ‚Äì smarter spelling fixes than traditional tools
- ü§ñ **Fewer false positives** ‚Äì avoids flagging uncommon but valid words
- üåê **Broad provider support** ‚Äì use OpenAI, Gemini, or xAI (Grok) out of the box
- üíª **Offline ready** ‚Äì run locally with Ollama and LlamaCpp, no cloud required
- üîí **Privacy** ‚Äì keep sensitive text local with offline models
- üõ†Ô∏è **Easy to use** ‚Äì provides an easy to use library and command-line utility

## Library

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "llm"
require "llm/spell"

##
# Text
llm  = LLM.openai(key: ENV["OPENAI_SECRET"])
text = LLM::Spell::Text.new("Ths is a smple txt with sme speling erors.", llm)
print "mistakes: ", text.mistakes, "\n"
print "corrections: ", text.corrections, "\n"

##
# PDF
llm  = LLM.openai(key: ENV["OPENAI_SECRET"])
file = LLM::Spell::Document.new("typos.pdf", llm)
print "mistakes: ", file.mistakes, "\n"
print "corrections: ", file.corrections, "\n"
```

## CLI

#### Configuration

The command line interface can be configured through the configuration file
located at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/llm-spell.yml` or `~/.config/llm-spell.yml`. This
step is required to use llm-spell from the command line but it is not required
when using llm-shell as a library:

```yaml
# ~/.config/llm-spell.yml
openai:
  key: YOURKEY
gemini:
  key: YOURKEY
xai:
  key: YOURKEY
ollama:
  host: localhost
  model: gpt-oss
llamacpp:
  host: localhost
```

#### Usage

```sh
Usage: llm-spell [OPTIONS]
    -p, --provider NAME              Required. Options: gemini, openai, xai, ollama or llamacpp.
    -f, --file FILE                  Required. The file to check.
    -v, --version                    Optional. Print the version and exit.
```

## Background

This project was born while I was working on the documentation
for a friend's open source project. After realizing how much
manual effort was involved with traditional spell checkers I
decided to see if I could leverage LLMs to make the process
easier and also faster.

Compared to traditional spell checkers like `aspell` and `hunspell`,
`llm-spell` provides significantly more accurate suggestions with
far fewer false positives &ndash; eliminating the need to manually
ignore irrelevant corrections, and that often reduces the overall
time spent on correcting spelling mistakes.

I would call the experiment a success but I also realize this
approach is not for everyone, or every situation. For example,
my friend preferred to not use AI for this and instead we opted
to stick with `hunspell` &ndash; even though it meant more
manual work.
