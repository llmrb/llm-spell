## About

llm-spell is a command-line utility that can correct spelling mistakes
with the help of a Large Language Model (LLM). Compared to traditional spell
checkers like `aspell` and `hunspell`, llm-spell often produces fewer
false positives and more accurate suggestions.

## Features

- ✨ **LLM-powered corrections** – smarter spelling fixes than traditional tools
- 🤖 **Fewer false positives** – avoids flagging uncommon but valid words
- 🌐 **Broad provider support** – use OpenAI, Gemini, or xAI (Grok) out of the box
- 💻 **Offline ready** – run locally with Ollama and LlamaCpp, no cloud required
- 🔒 **Privacy** – keep sensitive text local with offline models
- 🛠️ **Easy to use** – simple command-line interface for quick checks
